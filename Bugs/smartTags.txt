Title: Smart Tags are incorrect

Expected Behavior: Smart Tags should be correct
Actual Behavior: Smart Tags add tags that are incorrect for the image

Steps:
1. Import an image of a desert sunset (See image in images directory)
2. Examine smart tags

Notes: It got most of them correct, but there are no buildings and there is no architecture in the image.  As a feature request, I would also add the ability to edit these tags.
