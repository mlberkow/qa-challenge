Smart Tags Feature request

As a part of keywording and tagging images, those tags should be correct and complete.  One way to accomplish this is to add the ability to edit the tags.

For the same image in the Smart Tags bug, there should be a way to delete the tags that are not correct for the image, and to add tags that would also make sense.

Examples of tags that should be removed:
  architecture, building, panoramic(in this case, the image is the wrong aspect ratio to be a panorama)

Examples of tags that are questionable and should be up to the discression of the end user:
  tower (there is a deser tower in the image, but it may or may not be something that the user wants)

Examples of tags that could be added:
  sunset, desert
